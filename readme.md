# XRPL Tests

This is a collection of small scripts to test various things about the XRP Ledger. Each folder is a seperate test case with its own dependencies.

To run a test case, switch into its folder, run

```
npm install
```

to install any dependencies. Then run

```
node run
```

to run it. Test cases may have additional command line arguments. These will be documented in their respective directory.
